Dotfiles
========

.vimrc:
-------
* Several plugins can be installed with Vundle plugin (you should install vundle plugin at first).
* It contains configuration about searching, indent and color theme as well as mapping to create a great enviroment to start programming.
* You should read install instructions for every plugin :P

testem.json:
------------
* It works with jasmine unit test framework.
* It is configured to launch just Chrome.
* It takes all src and test files from their respective directories.

.jshintrc:
----------
* It works with vim if you know how.
* All options from http://www.jshint.com/docs/options/ can be configured.
* You can add globals to customize it even more.

Any commentary, question or doubt will be appreciated :)
