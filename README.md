.vimrc:
-------
* Several plugins can be installed with Vundle plugin (you should install vundle plugin at first).
* It contains configuration about searching, indent and color theme as well as mapping to create a great enviroment to start programming.
* You should read install instructions for every plugin :P

testem.json:
------------
* It works with jasmine unit test framework.
* It is configured to launch just Chrome.
* It takes all src and test files from their respective directories.

Any commentary, question or doubt will be appreciated :)
